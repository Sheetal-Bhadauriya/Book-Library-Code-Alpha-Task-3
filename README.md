# Book-Library

# Description
This is a web-based personal book library app where you can add books, search by title or author, and borrow books. It runs in a web browser, storing data locally using localStorage.

# Features
**Add New Book**: Enter book details (title, author, genre).

**Search Books**: Search by title or author.

**Borrow a Book**: Record who borrowed a book.

**Data Persistence**: Books and borrowing history are stored using localStorage, so the data remains even after closing the browser.
